            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HEnry</hi> the Third of that Name, (a man more pious, than prudent; a better man then a King) ſwayed the Scepter of this Kingdom fifty years. The former part of his Reign was very calm, the latter as Tempeſtuous.</p>
            <p>The main Tempeſt was thus raiſed. The King for many years, during that high calm, had ſequeſtred himſelf wholly to his harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſports and recreations, and intruſted the whole managery of the <hi>State</hi> to his Officers and Miniſters. Theſe taking advantage of his Majeſtie's careleſneſſe (the main fault of this King) inſenſibly ſuck't and drayned the Revenues of Crown and Kingdom; till the King awakened by extream neceſſity, began to enquire, not how he came in (for his neceſſities would not permit that) but how he might get out.</p>
            <p>The beſt way that his evil Counſellors could find to relieve their Maſter, &amp; ſave themſelves, was (the ordinary way of ſupply in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament declined) to have recourſe to Monopolies, Patents, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and illegal Taxations. But (praeter-natural courſes are never long-lived) the free-born <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not long endure ſuch ſlavery.</p>
            <p>When the King ſaw there was no other remedy, he throwes himſelf into the boſome of his people for relief, and advice in

            <p>And here they would make the people believe they ſhould never be troubled with licencious Soveraignty again; (but never more, as it proved:) for now every one of them began to value his own worth, and to hammer his head on every deſign that might enlarge his own power and command.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170614:5"/> King's ſide was the utter overthrow of the King's Forces: for when the Earle perceived that the Prince (a young fiery ſpirit) with all the Kings horſe was gone ſo far in purſuit of the <hi>Londoners,</hi>

            <p>And now the Earle believes all his own, and the people dream of nothing put Peace, but alas the War was not begun till now: For when the torn remainder of the Loyal Army that eſcaped at <hi>Lewes,</hi> now keeping Garriſon in <hi>Briſtow,</hi> and other noble ſpirits, ſaw how inſolently the Earle dealt with his, and their, Soveraign in barring him of his liberty, &amp;c.

            <p>Here the War grew hot, each ſide fortifying Towns and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, plundring and driving all round about to ſtore the garriſons: Men's houſes (which were wont to be their own Caſtles) were now made Caſtles, but the owners were leaſt Maſters; all left to the mercy of the rude Souldier, the poor Country-man's dwelling-houſe pillaged every where and ſearcht,<note n="*" place="margin">Riſhanger.</note>

            <p>When the Prince, the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> with the reliques of the royal Army were united and well ordered, they reſolved to give his Excellency (the Earl of <hi>Liceſter</hi>) bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: At <hi>Eveſham</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> by a ſpeedy and unexpected march, they came upon him. The Earl ſeeing himſelfe engaged to fight, gave order that his own coat-armour ſhould be put upon the King, who was then a priſoner in the Army, and that the King, (for the ſafety of his perſon forſooth) ſhould be placed in the front of the battell, that ſo if the battell went againſt him, the King might be aimed at as generall, and his excellency thereby make his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape. But the King at firſt charge called out to the loyall Army, that he was their King, and ſo was preſerved; yet not without the loſſe of ſome of his own, (being wounded by a javelin) as well as his Subjects blood: the battell was very violent, and went ſore againſt the Rebels; at length the Earl himſelfe (the head of this Rebellion) was cut off; at the inſtant of whoſe death, their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170614:6"/> ſuch extraordinary lightning, thunder, and thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it ſtruk a generall horror and amazement into the hearts of the Rebels, as if the King of Kings would now at laſt viſibly revenge the Kings quarrell, or as if they had ſeen Gods immediate hand againſt them; as once againſt <hi>Corah,</hi> and the 250. Aſſembly-men, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 35. for the like rebellious practiſes.</p>
            <p>In this ſignal Battell were ſlain, (beſides the Earl and his ſon) ſixteen Lords and Knights, and about ten thouſand more of the Rebells part.</p>
            <p>The Earl's Corps was ſtrangely (though not undeſervedly) handled by the people, who were ſo inraged againſt him, the chief actour and authour of their ſo much miſchiefe and miſery, that (in deſpight of him) they lopt off his head, hands, feet, and privie members, and ſent them (in ſcorn) for tokens to ſeverall places; his body was buried in <hi>Eveſham</hi> Church. Notwitghan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, there were many ignorant people (who had been by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences abuſed, and ſeduced to that ſide) that were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion for a long time after, that he dyed a Martyr, becauſe it was in defence of their holy (as they thought, but indeed impious) Covenant and Oath.</p>
            <p>Two of the Earl's ſons were at the ſame fight taken Priſoners: not long after they made an eſcape out of Priſon, but could not eſcape Gods vengeance on Rebells; for in <hi>France, in miſeras dies ſuos finiverunt.</hi>

            <p>Sixty or ſeventy wealthy Cicizens with all their Lands, Goods, and Cattles, did the King diſpoſe to his houſehold-ſervants.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170614:11"/> his promiſes, (perfidious ſubjects ever ſuſpect their Princes fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) which high inſolency of theirs (unheard of till our times) ſo exaſperates the King, that he reſolves to try the utmoſt to reduce them to their obedience; for that purpoſe marches with a mighty Army againſt them, the Prince alſo joyns with a conſiderable power; after many aſſaults, at length (after they had held it above two yeers) by the help of new made bridges and boats, they ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it on every ſide, that they were forced to yield.</p>
            <p>And now men thought the fire was quite out. But there were yet ſome live embers (which the Earle of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> upon ſome diſtaſte blowing) ſuddenly flamed out again in <hi>London,</hi> where the Commons of the City forgetting their late puniſhment, and as men (ſaith mine Author) without dread of God or the King: drew up in arms again, flock'd to the Earle of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi>

            <p>The King by a ſpeedy march came to the place at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but they inſtead of meeting his Majeſty, ran about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a tumultuos manner.

            <p>Then the King removed his camp to the other ſide of the City, and had his head quarters at <hi>Stratford,</hi> three miles off the City, the reſt of his Army lay at <hi>Ham,</hi> a village hard by. The wiſer Citizens foreſeeing the danger that hung over them, deſired a treaty with the King, whereunto (though they were moſt unworthy of ſo much clemency) his Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to condeſcend, and upon theſe eaſie terms they were again received to mercy.</p>

            <p>Thus, after the Almighty (whoſe judgements are unſearchable) had ſuffered crafty ſeditious ſpirits to ſeduce a whole Nation, to trample upon his Anointed, and to tread his Honour in the very duſt for a time, yet at length, all his enemies are clothed with ſhame, and upon himſelf his Crown flouriſheth again.</p>
            <p>And now after this furious dreadfull tempeſt, after ſo many ſtorms and ſhowers of blood, began a joyful long-expected Calm: which that they might enjoy without any intervening of more ſtormes, and for the better ſetling and quieting the Kingdom, the King gives expreſſe command for the razing of divers in-land Caſtles; as <hi>Farnham, &amp;c.</hi> That ſo if another Rebellion ſhould be begotten, it might no where find a Nurſe, and then it could not be long-liv'd.</p>

            <p>Theſe were the petty devices of that Age, to pump and drain the huge ſink of the Kingdome; but the Staple Policy was, by a Forraign Expedition (like a wide fluce) to let out all the filth at once: for which purpoſe therefore (among others) it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon, that a great Army ſhould be raiſed under the command of the Prince, for a voyage to Paleſtine.
